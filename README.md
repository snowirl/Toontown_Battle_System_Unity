# Toontown Battle System in Unity

This is a a barebones fan-made recreation of the battle system from Disney's Toontown Online. Please note this is not a complete project as there are tracks and many gags missing and bugs/glitches or unfinished movie animations. This was just a test of understanding how to implement turn-based mechanics in a multiplayer setting. I am not affiliated with The Walt Disney Company and/or the Disney Interactive Media Group.

IMPORTANT: When opening this project in Unity, please use version 2021.3.8f1. 

Mirror networking is used for multiplayer. Please install the Mirror package as well if it is not included.
